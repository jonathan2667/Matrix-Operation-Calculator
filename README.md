# Sort-C-

Sort-C- is a C# application designed to visually represent the sorting of a collection of numbers using the selection sort algorithm. The sorting process is displayed graphically in an n x n grid format, where 'n' represents the number of items to sort. This visual approach helps to understand the sorting steps and the efficiency of the algorithm.

## Features

- Graphical representation of the selection sort algorithm.
- Interactive UI to control the number of elements and initiate the sort.
- Step-by-step visualization of the sorting process, including swaps and comparisons.
